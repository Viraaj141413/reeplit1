# AI App Builder - Replit Clone

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application that replicates Replit's functionality, allowing users to create, edit, and deploy applications through an AI-powered interface. The system combines a React frontend with an Express backend, featuring real-time code generation, project management, and live preview capabilities.

## System Architecture

- **Code Editor**: Custom implementation with syntax highlighting

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth integration (optional for development)
