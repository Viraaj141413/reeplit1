Use a Loop to keep it running
Wrap your AI bot’s main task inside a loop (like a while loop) that keeps running until the task is fully done.
python
Copy
Edit
task_completed = False

while not task_completed:
try:
# Run your AI bot task
run_ai_task()

    # Check if the task is fulfilled
    if check_task_fulfilled():
        task_completed = True
    else:
        print("Task not fulfilled, retrying...")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error occurred: {e}, troubleshooting and retrying...")
2. Add Error Handling to catch problems and keep retrying
Use try-except blocks (or equivalent in your language) so if something goes wrong, the bot doesn’t stop — it logs the error and tries again.

Add Delay or Backoff
If your bot keeps failing immediately, adding a small delay before retrying helps avoid overwhelming systems or getting stuck in an infinite fast loop.
python
Copy
Edit
import time

time.sleep(2) # Wait 2 seconds before retrying
4. (Optional) Add a Max Retry Limit
If you want, you can limit retries to avoid endless loops, or you can keep going forever.

Summary:
Wrap your AI task in a loop

Use error handling to catch problems

Retry until the task completes

Optionally add delays between retries

and Sure! Here’s a simple explanation of your idea:

You want to build an AI chatbot that talks with the user interactively, like a real conversation. While chatting, the bot also creates and updates files in the background—for example, saving the conversation or generating other documents—without stopping or interrupting the chat flow.

This means your bot is doing two things at once:

Chatting live: continuously taking user input, generating replies, and showing them immediately.

Working behind the scenes: creating or updating files automatically based on the chat or other logic, without making the user wait.

The challenge is to make sure the bot stays responsive while handling background tasks smoothly. Usually, this is done by:

Using loops to keep the conversation going

Handling file creation or updates asynchronously or in parallel so the chat doesn’t freeze

Managing errors and retries so both chatting and file handling keep working reliably

Does that capture your idea?

I'll implement both features: a continuous loop system with error handling and retry logic, plus the ability to handle chat conversations while creating files in the background. Let me enhance the AI system with these capabilities.

panel moves or scrolls too, causing everything to shift or jump out of place.

This usually happens if both sections scroll together, or if the layout isn’t fixed or pinned properly.

What you want:
The files preview sidebar stays fixed or sticky on the side — it doesn’t scroll with the main content

The main content area (chat or whatever) scrolls independently

The UI stays stable, no unexpected shifting or resizing

How to fix it (general ideas):
Use CSS position: sticky or position: fixed for the sidebar
Make the files preview container sticky so it stays visible as you scroll the main content.

Separate scroll areas
Make sure the main content and the sidebar each have their own scroll container, so scrolling one doesn’t affect the other.

Set fixed widths/heights
Fix the width of the sidebar and height of the containers to prevent layout shifts.

Use Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout
This helps keep the sidebar and main content side-by-side and stable.

Example CSS snippet:
css
Copy
Edit
.app-container {
display: flex;
height: 100vh; /* full viewport height */
}

.files-preview {
position: sticky;
top: 0;
width: 300px;
height: 100vh;
overflow-y: auto; /* if files list is long */
background: #f0f0f0;
}

.main-content {
flex-grow: 1;
overflow-y: auto; /* scroll main content */
height: 100vh;
}
