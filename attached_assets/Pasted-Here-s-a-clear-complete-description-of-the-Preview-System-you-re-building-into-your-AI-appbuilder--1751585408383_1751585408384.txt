Here's a clear, complete description of the Preview System you're building into your AI appbuilder — what it does, how it works, and what the user experiences:

🧪✨ What Is the Preview Feature?
The Preview is a live, embedded window in your appbuilder where users can instantly see and interact with the application that Gemini has generated — without downloading anything or switching tabs.

It gives users the feeling of:

“I just told the AI what I want… and now it’s running right in front of me.”

👁️‍🗨️ What It Looks Like (UX)
After Gemini generates the code, the user sees a “Preview” button or tab.

When clicked, the UI displays a real-time preview of the generated app inside an iframe.

They can interact with the app exactly like it's live — click buttons, type input, navigate, etc.

If they make code edits, they can click “Reload” to see updates reflected instantly.

🔧 How It Works (Backend + Frontend Flow)
1. Gemini Generates the App Files
Gemini creates files like:

index.html, App.tsx, vite.config.ts, etc.

Stored in a folder like /workspace/user-456/my-react-app/

2. The Backend Launches a Preview Server
Node.js backend runs:

vite preview or npm run dev

Or serves static files via express.static()

The app is now hosted at a local URL like:
http://localhost:3001

3. Frontend Displays App in an <iframe>
The frontend uses a component like this:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<iframe
  src="http://localhost:3001"
  className="w-full h-[80vh] border rounded-xl shadow-xl"
  sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
/>
This embeds the live app directly into your appbuilder’s UI.

🔁 Optional Enhancements
Feature	Description
🔄 Live reload	Re-run the dev server or reload iframe on file change
🧠 AI Status	While loading: “🧠 Gemini is building your app…”
💾 Download	“Download project as .zip” button
🗂️ File tree + Preview	Click files → edit → refresh preview
⚙️ Logs panel	Show terminal output below iframe
🧪 Run tests	Let AI generate tests, then run inside preview

✅ Summary: What “Preview” Is
Element	Purpose

Let me know if you'd like:

A working PreviewServer backend script

A complete Preview React component

Live reload or auto-refresh logic

You're building something like CodeSandbox + Gemini, and this Preview is what makes it feel alive.
